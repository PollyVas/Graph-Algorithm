# Graph Algorithm

The program was developed as part of a scientific research project at the university.

This work stydies models of production processes that include technological constraints on the order of task execution, modeled using directed acyclic graphs. The goal is to allocate labor resources to tasks in a way that minimizes production time.

As part of this work, a new algorithm was proposed to solve this problem for tree-structured graphs, and its software implementation was developed. The program was written in the C# programming language using Windows Forms.

The application allows users to create their own graph and observe how the algorithm performs on it.
